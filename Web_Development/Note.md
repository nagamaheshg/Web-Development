Lists:

    An Unordered HTML list:                An ordered  HTML list:
        item                                   1. First item
        Item                                   2. Second item
        Item                                   3. Third item

    special HTML tags are used to create lists, which allow for the presentation of information in an organization and structured manner.

        There are two types of lists in HTML:

            1. Unordered lists:
                create using ul tag
                List items are added using li tag
                Bullet points are used to denote list items
                Appearance of bullet points can be customized with CSS

            2. Ordered lists are created using the <ol> tag.
                Items are numbered or lettered automatically.
                The <li> tag is used for each list item in an ordered list.
                The numbering or lettering style can be customized using the type attribute or CSS.

            Lists can be nested, meaning you can place one list inside another. This works for both unordered and ordered lists, and you can even mix them together. Hereâ€™s how nested lists work:

Let's some footer items to our page using ul tag:

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li> Courses </li>
            <li> Programs </li>
            <li> Youtube </li>
        </ul>

        <span>&copy; 2024, Jovain</span>
    </div>

Links:
In HTML, links are created using the <a> (anchor) tag. Links can point to other web pages, sections within the same page, email addresses, or even initiate downloads. Here's a breakdown:

    The a tag must have an href attribute that specifies the URL of the destination page.

    The link that is displayed as the link is placed between the Open and closing a tags.

    You can use target attribute to specify where the lined page should be opened, such as in a new tab or window.

    You can also create links to specific sections of a page by using the id attribute to identify the section and adding it to the URL in the href attribute.

Images:

    The image tag is used to add images to an HTML Page.

    The src attribute of the img tag is used to specify the URL or file path of the image

    The alt Provides a text description of the image. This is displayed if the image fails to load and is also important for accessibility.

    width: Specifies the width of the image in pixels or percentage.

    height: Specifies the height of the image in pixels or percentage.

    Specifies whether the image should load immediately or lazily (when it comes into view).

    lazy: Defers loading until the image is visible.
    eager: Loads immediately.

    The title Provides additional information about the image. This text appears as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
